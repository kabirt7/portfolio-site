## HOSTING 

https://stellular-cuchufli-a53c45.netlify.app/

## DESIGN GOALS

- using a scroll snap vertical design. restrained use of color. I like a clean palette and the magenta is a bold color
- responsive and polished design 
- home, about, tech stack (in about), project, contact sections
- branch for each section
- This was one of my first projects. Iâ€™m going to keep it in basic HTML instead of React/TS like my other projects to keep as a reference

## KNOWN PROBLEMS

- Need to add other projects into work page
- Styling for work page needs to be edited. A bit messy and not as clean as I want.
- Work page needs to be longer instead of the same size and overflow: scroll.
- Need to fix how navbar appears when this happens

## MVP

* SCSS for styling.
* B.E.M as a naming convention.
* Responsive

Should have the following section:

* A landing page/section with your name and title on it.
* An About page/section with a little bit about you
* A Tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs you have learned during the course
* A Project page/section with all your projects 
* A Contact page/section with your email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link

## STRUGGLES

- Marquee was complex to make responsive
- Overall styling was difficult due to specific nature of my design

## PAGE BREAKDOWN/FEATURES

### navbar

- using simple js and scroll snap to smoothly transition between pages

### home

- using a simple marquee effect 

### about

- Intro and a pic in a faux window
