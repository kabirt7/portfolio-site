# portfolio-site

- using a scroll snap vertical design
- html pages per section to make easier to navigate, using iframe to import into index
- accesible, responsive, simple, polished design that is representative of me and my practice - inspired by a physical folder
- home, about, tech stack, project, contact sections
- drawing on a previous portfolio project I've made before hence some animations/styling added directly
- branch for each section
